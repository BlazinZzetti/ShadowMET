# ShadowMET
 Tool to edit .met files used to locate and display text for .fnt files.

 Currently requires providing PNG exports of the TXD files for visual data.

### TODO
- [ ] Open .TXD files directly
- [ ] Allow adding new unicodes
- [ ] Pixel editing of image
  - Im thinking limited greyscale palette due to .TXD settings.
- [ ] Add support for what looks to be a comment section per character?
  - At least 1 character comment based on a similar file found in Sonic Heroes.
